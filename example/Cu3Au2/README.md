# Example 

This exmpale contains three run folders, i.e. run0, run1, and run2. 
Folder run0 contain a GOFEE input file "Cu3Au2.py". 
Folder run1 and run2 is just a dummy folder which already contain a trajectory file "structures.traj". 

Uppon execution, by ```python Cu3Au2.py```, the modified GOFEE code will check the similarity between the obtained structure of every run and all the structure that allready written in the "structure.traj" file inside run0, run1, and run2 folder.
