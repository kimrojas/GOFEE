Getting started
===============

GOFEE is implemented in python, so a basic understanding of python
is neccisary to use the program.

In addition it relies heavily on the python library ASE
(Atomic Simulation Environment). In particular, some ASE methods
are used to set up the atomistic system of interest, prior to a
GOFEE search. It is therefore a prerequisite to also have basic
experience with especially the :class:`Atoms` object of ASE as well as
trajectory files.

Before continuing complete the :ref:`installation guide <installation>`,
if you have not done it already.

Otherwise you can start getting familiar with GOFEE by going through
some of the examples in the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.
